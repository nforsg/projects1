    RULES:
    LIVE CELL: 
    If the live cell is a predator:

    - If the surrounding cells sum up to at least 3 omnivores, the predator dies. 
    CORRECTION: Okay, no, we don't want this. In irrelevant for predators to kill each other and reproduct at the same time.
    - If the surrounding cells sum up to at least 4 herbavores, the predator dies.
    CORRECTION: Instead, we can formulate the following:
    - Predators get -1 in nergy for each time it doesn't kill/eat. If energy = 0, it dies.
    
    If the live cell is an omnivore:
    - If the surrounding cells sum up to 3 herbavores or more, the omnivore dies.
    - If the surrounding cells sum up to at least 1 predator, the omnivore dies.
    
    If the live cell is a herbavore:
    - If the surrounding cells sum up to to at least 1 predator, the herbavore dies.
    - If the surrounding cells sum up to at least 2 omnivores, the herbavore dies.


    DEAD CELL:
    1) If the middle cell is dead and its neighbour cell is excactly 
    three live cells of its own species, it becomes a live cell.
